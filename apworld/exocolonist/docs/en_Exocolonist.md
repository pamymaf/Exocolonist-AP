# What's randomized?

## Locations

Every job you can unlock is a location.

### Friendsanity

If enabled, each multiple of 20 friendship points for each character is a check.

### Datesanity

If enabled, dating each character is a check.

### Perksanity

If enabled, each skill perk is a check. Additionally, skills will be locked so you cannot progress past a perk you don't have. As an example, if you have perception perk 1 you can level your perception to 66. But if you have no perks, you can only level the skill to 33.
